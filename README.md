# Springboard-Mini-Projects
Small analytics projects for Springboard's Data Science Intensive online bootcamp

## 1) Exploratory Data Analysis 1 - Human Body Temperature
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of human body temperatures by employing the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

## 2) Exploratory Data Analysis 2 - Racial Discrimination
In this project, I performed a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

## 3) Exploratory Data Analysis 3 - Hospital Readmissions
In this project, I critiqued a preliminary analysis for reducing hospital readmissions rate, and then constructed a statistically sound analysis with recommendations of my own

## 4) Linear Regression - Boston Housing
In this project, I conducted a thorough linear regression analysis using 13 features of Boston houses to predict house price.

## 5) Logistic Regression - Height, Weight, & Gender
In this project, I built a logistic regression model that uses a person's height & weight to predict their gender with 92% accuracy.

## 6) Text Classification with Naive Bayes - Movie Ratings & Reviews
In this project, I conducted text classification using Naive Bayes to predict movie ratings as "fresh" (>75%) or "rotten" based on film critics' choice of words.

Then, using information retrieval and feature selection, I was able to calculate the predictive power of each word in the corpus to determine which critics' words were most/least indicative of their movie rating.

The Rotten Tomatoes dataset consisted of 15,561 reviews by 623 critics on 1,921 movies from 2000-2009.

## 7) Clustering - Customer Segmentation
In this project, I used k-means clustering to perform customer segmentation.

For each customer, I created a feature profile by considering data from:
1) email campaigns: which offers the customer responded to
2) transaction history: what products the customer ended up buying

To choose the optimal optimal k value (i.e. # of clusters), I used the elbow sum-of-squares and silhoutte method.

Finally, to visualize the 32-dimensional datset on a simple 2D graph, I used PCA for dimension reduction.

## 8) JSON Exercises
In this project, I familiarized myself with packages for dealing with JSON and worked on exercises with files & strings.
