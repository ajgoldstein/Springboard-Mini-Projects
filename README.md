# Springboard-Mini-Projects
Small analytics projects for Springboard's Data Science Intensive online bootcamp

## 1) Exploratory Data Analysis 1 - Human Body Temperature
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of human body temperatures by employing the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance. 

## 2) Exploratory Data Analysis 2 - Racial Discrimination
In this project, I performed a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

## 3) Exploratory Data Analysis 3 - Hospital Readmissions
In this project, I critiqued a preliminary analysis for reducing the readmissions rate and constructed a statistically sound analysis with recommendations of my own

## 4) Linear Regression - Boston Housing
In this project, I used the "Boston House Price" dataset to conduct a thorough linear regression analysis across 13 possible features, identified the best possible model using AIC, and corrected for residual assumptions by removing outliers.
